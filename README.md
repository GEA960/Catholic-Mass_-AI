# Catholic-Mass_-AI
An AI that will detect what a parish priest was saying on the mass and will play a certain music on every part of the mass if reached certain sound parameters.

The goal of this project is to aid the choir in any parishes if ever no one or the person who were assigned to that job is not available and can't facilitate the music accompaniment of the mass. The AI will be the one who will play the music in minus one or with voice. It will depend on the availability of the choir.


PROGRAMMERS!

Let's create an AI na magpa play ng music whether minus one or may voice once reached ang some parameters. I just have an idea to give support sa choir once hindi po available ang tagatugtog or taga play ng accompaniment. 

Parameters:
     The AI will play a mass song depende sa sinabi na words ng pari and ng commentator sa misa. So real-time processing po.
     So every cue from the parish priests' word, papatugtugin ng AI ang mga naka assign na songs line up for that Mass. 

P.S. aaralin ko pa po ito from scratch sa python. So kung may gusto po makipag collaborate, please connect with me. Thank you!
