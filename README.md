# Catholic-Mass_-AI
An AI that will detect what a parish priest was saying on the mass and will play a certain music on every part of the mass if reached certain sound parameters.

The goal of this project is to aid the choir in any parishes if ever no one can facilitate the music accompaniment of the mass. The AI will be the one who will play the music in minus one or with voice. It will depend on the availability of the choir.
